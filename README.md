This is my first Flutter practice project, a simple e-commerce application built using the Flutter framework. The project includes basic features such as product listings, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process. It serves as a hands-on exercise to learn and practice Flutter concepts like UI design, state management, and integration with APIs. This repository contains the complete source code of the e-commerce app, along with relevant documentation and instructions for setup and usage.
